Recognition of Competence: Licensure demonstrates that an ISE has met specific educational and experience requirements, ensuring they possess the necessary knowledge and skills to practice in the field.
Protection if the Public: Licensure protects the public by ensuring that engineers adhere to ethical standards and professional conduct, thereby reducing the risk of incompetence or malpractice.
Marketability: Holding a professional license enhances an ISE's marketability and credibility to potential employers and clients, as it signifies a commitment to high standards and ongoing professional development.
Legal Standing: Licensure provides legal recognition of an ISE's expertise, enabling them to engage in certain activities that may require licensure, such as signing off on engineering designs or serving as expert witnesses in legal proceedings.
Global Mobility: In some cases, licensure can facilitate mobility across borders by allowing industrial engineers to practice internationally, provided they meet equivalent licensure requirements in other jurisdictions.
Overall, professional licensure enhances the reputation, credibility, and opportunities for ISE's while safeguarding the public interest. Join our panel discussion to hear how licensure could fit into your career path and then visit us at the NCEES booth for a free practice exam!

While digital twins are widely used in manufacturing, they are equally valuable in other process-driven environments such as warehousing, healthcare operations, and service systems. We share technical insights and practical examples highlighting Simio’s modeling methodologies and tools for digital twin implementation. Key topics include custom objects, data integration through connectors, Simio Processes, and scripting support. Additionally, we introduce Simio University, a training platform that supports users in learning Simio modeling and development.

Title: Modern Methods, Languages, and Use Cases in Simulation Modeling
Abstract: A workshop from the vendor of AnyLogic – an agnostic multi-method simulation software with the largest worldwide user community. Based on AnyLogic usage statistics, we will show which modeling methods, techniques, and languages are most used today by the industry. This includes DES (process flowcharts), Agent-based modeling, Statecharts, System Dynamics, GIS-based modeling, and others. We will also talk about the recent (and very positive) shift from the project-based usage of simulation to operational use and, therefore, longer lifecycles of models (digital twinning, etc.); we will present some use cases and go through the new requirements to simulations. Finally, we will touch the current relationship of Simulation and AI: what worked, what did not work, and what to expect.
